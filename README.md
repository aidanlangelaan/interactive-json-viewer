# Interactive JSON viewer

This is a test project for building an interactive JSON viewer. With the viewer I want users to be able to view a logical and clear representation of a JSON document and to be able to get the JSON-paths to specific nodes.

## Test files

The assets directory contains two sample JSON files:

- example_1.json
- example_2.json

Both files have been generated using online JSON generators.
